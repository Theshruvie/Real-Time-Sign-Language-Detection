# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Detection

This repository contains code for real-time sign language detection using computer vision techniques. It leverages the power of OpenCV for video capture and image manipulation, MediaPipe for robust hand tracking, and NumPy for efficient numerical operations.

Key Features:

Real-time Hand Tracking: Utilizes MediaPipe's Hand Tracking solution to accurately identify and track the key landmarks of the hands in video streams.
Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant features from the tracked hand landmarks (e.g., joint positions, distances, angles) using NumPy for efficient processing.
Sign Language Classification: Implements a machine learning model (e.g., a simple classifier or a more complex deep learning model - the specific model used would be detailed in the repository) trained on a dataset of sign language gestures.
Clear and Modular Code: The codebase is structured for readability and ease of understanding, with separate modules for hand tracking, feature extraction, and classification.
Integration with OpenCV: Uses OpenCV for capturing video from webcams or video files and for displaying the results with overlaid hand landmarks and predicted signs.
Extensibility: The framework is designed to be easily extended with new sign language gestures by collecting more data and retraining the classification model.
Potential Applications:

Real-time communication aid for individuals with hearing impairments.
Interactive learning tools for sign language.
Human-computer interaction using hand gestures.
Accessibility solutions for various applications.

Future Enhancements (Optional):

(This section could outline potential future developments, such as:

Support for more complex sign language grammar.
Integration with other modalities (e.g., speech).
Improved model accuracy and robustness.
Deployment on embedded devices.
Creation of a larger and more diverse sign language dataset.
